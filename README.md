Lenses â€“ My Motion Detection Algorithm I Created From Scratch
ðŸš§ Status: Ongoing Development ðŸš§

Overview
Lenses is my custom-built motion detection algorithm, developed entirely from scratch. Unlike traditional motion detection systems that rely on existing computer vision libraries like OpenCV, this project takes a raw, first-principles approach to detecting movement in video files.It's my personal take on motion detection and purely written from scratch without utilising pre-existing libraries.

Why This Project?
No reliance on pre-built computer vision algorithms.
A truly handcrafted motion detection system.
Built using pure Python + NumPy for performance optimization.
